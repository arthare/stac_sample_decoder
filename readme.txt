There's a .sln file in the lzfse directory that compiles the lzfse decoder and the sample stac decoder.

There's a sample .stac file in /simple_stac_decoder called tulipsOnTable.stac.

This has, as of March 22 2017, only been compiled in Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop.  I tried to make it not-particularly-microsoftey, so it should be easy to compile in other areas.

Good luck!
